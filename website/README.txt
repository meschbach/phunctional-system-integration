This is the home website for PSI.  The PHP pages are intended to generate static HTML pages and should not be deployed as the pages have not been built with security in mind.

To build the site use install.sh.  The tools in the variables section may be set on the command line to ease installation.  If the file doesn't work for you please file an issue.
